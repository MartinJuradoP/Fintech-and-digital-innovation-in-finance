    " # 📌 Objectives\n",
    " \n",
    " By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
    "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
    "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
    "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
    "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
    "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
    "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
    "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
    "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",
    "    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."

    "What surprised me the most was Baker Hughes (BKR) and Expedia (EXPE). Baker Hughes is primarily an energy and industrial company, so seeing it with 3 mentions was unexpected. However, after some research, I found they have a joint venture focused on AI solutions, which explains its presence. Expedia’s appearance is also interesting since it’s a travel company, but it has been integrating AI to enhance customer experience and trip planning.\n",

    "For a production-scale search system, the combination of the `'all-mpnet-base-v2'` embedding model with the FAISS vector store implementation is the best choice. The `'all-mpnet-base-v2'` model provides stronger semantic understanding and retrieves higher-quality, contextually relevant results, especially for complex queries such as \"Mergers and acquisitions\" and \"Fed interest rate.\" Its ability to capture deeper relationships between terms leads to more precise and meaningful matches.\n",

It supports fast approximate nearest neighbor retrieval, can handle large datasets with millions of documents, and benefits from GPU acceleration for low latency. These features make FAISS ideal for production environments where speed and scalability are critical.\n",

    "While a custom vector store implementation may work well for smaller datasets or experimental setups, it typically relies on brute-force similarity calculations, which do not scale efficiently as data volume grows. Moreover, custom implementations might lack the robustness and optimizations present in mature libraries like FAISS.\n",

    "Therefore, combining the high-performance `'all-mpnet-base-v2'` embeddings with FAISS provides the best balance of semantic accuracy, scalability, and speed for production systems. In contrast, if computational resources are limited or latency demands are low, a custom store with a lighter model like `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'` might be a reasonable compromise."

    "FAISS clearly scales better as the dataset grows from 5,000 to 5 million articles. This is because FAISS is purpose-built for large-scale similarity search and provides advanced, optimized indexing structures such as IVF (Inverted File Index) and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs). These structures enable fast and memory-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval, significantly reducing search time even as data volume increases.\n",

    "In contrast, a custom implementation based on brute-force cosine similarity requires comparing the query against every document vector sequentially. This results in linear growth of search time and memory consumption, which quickly becomes impractical as the dataset expands. Without optimized indexing or approximation techniques, the system would suffer from high latency and excessive resource use, making it unsuitable for real-time or large-scale applications.\n",
