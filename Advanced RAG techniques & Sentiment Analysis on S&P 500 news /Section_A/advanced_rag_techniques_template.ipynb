    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and Use a Synthetic Evaluation Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Automatically generate natural language questions corresponding to news articles using an LLM.\n",
    "   - Construct a test set to assess the quality of retrieved answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Baseline RAG Performance Without Reranking:**\n",
    "   - Measure how often the original article appears in the top-k results using FAISS alone.\n",
    "   - Record retrieval accuracy and position for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply a Cross-Encoder Reranker to Improve Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Use a pretrained CrossEncoder model to rerank top FAISS results.\n",
    "   - Evaluate improvements in the ranking of correct articles after reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare Retrieval Performance With and Without Reranking:**\n",
    "   - Compute and visualize differences in rank positions before and after reranking.\n",
    "   - Analyze statistical improvements (e.g., average rank, frequency at position 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reflect on the Impact of Reranking in RAG Pipelines:**\n",
    "   - Discuss how reranking enhances retrieval quality in a RAG context.\n",
    "   - Identify scenarios where reranking may offer the most value, and propose further improvements.\n"

    "👉 **Instructions**:\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of reranking using your results.\n",
    "- Write short answers to the following:\n",
    "  1. Did reranking improve the **average position** of the correct news?\n",
    "  2. How often was the correct article at **position 0** with and without reranking?\n",
    "- You may use:\n",
    "  - Value counts (`.value_counts()`)\n",
    "  - Descriptive statistics (`.mean()`, `.median()`)\n",
    "  - Simple plots (e.g. bar charts or histograms)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This is your opportunity to reflect on the performance of the reranker and think critically about retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✨ Optional: You can create a summary table comparing the overall accuracy and coverage between the two methods."

    "Although reranking was expected to improve retrieval accuracy, in practice the opposite happened. Several attempts were made with the CrossEncoder reranker (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L12-v2`), but in all cases the number of **“not found”** results increased significantly after reranking (from 43% without reranker to 90% with reranker).\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome suggests that the reranker systematically pushed the correct articles outside the top-5, even when FAISS alone had retrieved them correctly. The exact reason is not fully clear, but possible explanations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Domain mismatch:** The CrossEncoder model was trained on MS MARCO web search data, which may not generalize well to financial news.\n",
    "* **Feature differences:** FAISS retrieval uses dense embeddings of summaries, while the reranker evaluates raw text pairs; the news summaries may be too short or lack enough context for the reranker to score them properly.\n",
    "* **Data noise or overlap:** Some summaries may be semantically similar, causing the reranker to mis-rank them despite FAISS finding the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** While reranking was tested in different ways, the increase in **“not found”** cases makes it clear that this particular reranker did not add value for this dataset. A better approach may involve fine-tuning a reranker model on domain-specific (financial/news) question–answer pairs, or combining reranker scores with FAISS similarity scores instead of replacing them.\n"
