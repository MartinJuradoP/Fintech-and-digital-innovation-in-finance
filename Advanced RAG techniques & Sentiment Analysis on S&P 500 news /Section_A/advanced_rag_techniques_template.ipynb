    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and Use a Synthetic Evaluation Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Automatically generate natural language questions corresponding to news articles using an LLM.\n",
    "   - Construct a test set to assess the quality of retrieved answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Baseline RAG Performance Without Reranking:**\n",
    "   - Measure how often the original article appears in the top-k results using FAISS alone.\n",
    "   - Record retrieval accuracy and position for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply a Cross-Encoder Reranker to Improve Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Use a pretrained CrossEncoder model to rerank top FAISS results.\n",
    "   - Evaluate improvements in the ranking of correct articles after reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare Retrieval Performance With and Without Reranking:**\n",
    "   - Compute and visualize differences in rank positions before and after reranking.\n",
    "   - Analyze statistical improvements (e.g., average rank, frequency at position 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reflect on the Impact of Reranking in RAG Pipelines:**\n",
    "   - Discuss how reranking enhances retrieval quality in a RAG context.\n",
    "   - Identify scenarios where reranking may offer the most value, and propose further improvements.\n"

    "  2. How often was the correct article at **position 0** with and without reranking?\n",
    "- You may use:\n",

    "  - Descriptive statistics (`.mean()`, `.median()`)\n",
    "  - Simple plots (e.g. bar charts or histograms)\n",
