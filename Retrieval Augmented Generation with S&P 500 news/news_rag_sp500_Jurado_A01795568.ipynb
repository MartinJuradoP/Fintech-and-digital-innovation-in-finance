    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore how to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using financial news articles from S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by vectorizing text data, creating a vector store using FAISS, and integrating it with OpenAI's GPT models to answer questions using retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow emulates real-world systems in finance where natural language data (news, filings, analyst reports) are used to support decision-making."

    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
    "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
    "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.\n",
    "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
    "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
    "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
    "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
    "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
    "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

       "Investor sentiment in recent financial headlines is characterized by a mix of optimism and skepticism. On one hand, there is a bullish outlook, with analysts highlighting attractive price targets and favorable catalysts for certain stocks, suggesting potential upside (as seen in the articles on Microchip Technology and Revvity). However, this optimism is tempered by a cautionary note regarding the reliability of these forecasts, as analysts face institutional pressures that may lead to overly positive assessments (noted in the articles about CarMax and Monolithic Power Systems). Additionally, there is recognition of bearish sentiment on specific stocks, advising investors to be cautious, particularly when Wall Street issues grim ratings (as noted with Darden Restaurants). Overall, while there is enthusiasm for certain stocks, there is also a clear call for skepticism about the underlying fundamentals and the potential influence of analyst conflicts of interest.\n"
